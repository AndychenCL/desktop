Aard Dictionary's JSON article format supports special tag for marking
up phonetic transcription. Font for the article text 
marked as phonetic transcription can be assigned through
:menuselection:`View --> Phonetic Font...` menu. 
Often phonetic transcription is written with
characters from `International Phonetic Alphabet`_ (IPA). Phonetic
transcription in IPA can also be found in many Wikipedia articles. To
have IPA symbols displayed properly you may want to install one of the
excellent IPA fonts available at http://scripts.sil.org.

You also may need to install additional fonts if you use dictionaries
that use script not available on your system. `WAZU JAPAN's Gallery of
Unicode Fonts`_ is an excellent resource for various unicode fonts.  

To install fonts on Maemo simply create ``/home/user/.fonts``
directory and copy font files there. New fonts should now appear in
font selection dialog. 

If you don't like or know how to copy font files into ``/home/user/.fonts``
you may install `Doulos SIL Font package`_ with Maemo Application
Manager.
